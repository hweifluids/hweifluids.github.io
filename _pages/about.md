Huanxia is an enrolled PhD student at the Aerodynamics Research Group at the School of MACE, University of Manchester (**UoM**) under supervision of Prof. Shan Zhong.

Before joining UoM, he graduted from CDHAW of **Tongji** University with a bachelor's degree and honored with outstanding thesis student, and served as a part-time research assistant at Shanghai Automotive Wind Tunnel Center (**SAWTC**). Then he graduated from Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore (**NUS**) with a master's degree with distinction and Grade-A Thesis. He worked at Aerodynamics Acoustics & Noise control Technology Centre (AANTC) of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**) as a research assistant, and later worked at TenFong Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (**TenFong**) as a research engineer in aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, developing CFD-CAA techniques and related post-processing function points.

His research interest includes aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. He is familiar with 3D data-driven tools (DMD, POD, SPOD) and Lagrangian coherent structure identification (by FTLE). He is the sole developer of **PyFTLE3D** GUI toolbox for LCS research. On the other hand, he is interested in experimental fluid mechanics, especially low-speed wind tunnel testing. 

His long-term cooperating institutes include SAWTC of Tongji University (on eVTOLs and ground vehicles), Chalmers University of Technology (on bluff body and train aerodynamics), NEV research center of Tongji University (on hydrogen), National Meteorological Information Centre of China Meteorological Administration (on microscale systems and low-altitude CFD).
