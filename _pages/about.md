**Note: HERE is the webpage for self-use only! Leave here and visit [published website](https://fluids.ac) unless you are DIRECTLY INVITED by huanxia. There are lots of incorrect and confidential information on the internal version of website!**

Huanxia is an enrolled PhD student at the Aerodynamics Research Group at the School of MACE, University of Manchester **UoM** under supervision of Prof. Shan Zhong (FRAeS).

Before joining UoM, he first graduted from CDHAW, **Tongji** University with a bachelor's degree and honored with outstanding thesis student, and served as a part-time research assistant at Shanghai Automotive Wind Tunnel Center (SAWTC). Then he graduated from Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore (**NUS**) with a master's degree with distinction and Grade-A Thesis. He worked at The Aerodynamics Acoustics & Noise control Technology Centre (AANTC) of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**) as a research assistant. Later, he worked at TenFong Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (**TenFong**) as a research engineer in aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, developing CFD-CAA solvers and related post-processors.

His research interest includes aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. On one hand, he employs DNS-based high-order spectral element method (SEM), mainly Nek5000, to solve basic fluid mechanics problems, and on the other hand, he also uses commercial CFD tools like Star-CCM+ to simulate engineering cases like automobiles, eVTOLs, and bicycle frameworks. Additionally, he is familiar with 3D data-driven tools (DMD, POD, SPOD) and Lagrangian coherent structure identification (by FTLE). On the other hand, he is interested in experimental fluid mechanics, especially low-speed wind tunnel testing.
